A Game with phases. Evolves with time. Require Cooperation.

# Phase A

People rise from cryosleep. Most of the ship has been destroyed. Ship never reached its destination. They lost contact with Earth long ago. Ship is wandering through space. Some Zones needs repairing. Some others need to be rebuilt entirely. Monsters are crawling through the ship.
Those aren't aliens. Only former pets that mutated and created their own society in abandoned parts of the huge vessel.
The ship itself has been conceived as a small planet, through different layers.
The upper layer is devoted to farming and reproduces an earthlike environment, under a giant dome of glass.
The layers underneath a labyrinth of rooms and destroyed vessel ailes.
Players pop inside the cryosleep zone with other new players.
During the first phase Players who die have no other choice than to create a new player.

They will need to cooperate to :

*   Feed
*   Heal from injuries and radiation
*   Heal their wounds
*   Secure a few zones
*   Revive their deads
*   Have at least one Faction ruling the place

Once they are effectively farming, and people stop dying from hunger (build a few farms). Once they are able to feed and heal from radiations and injuries (hunters and farming gather resources required to heal people and revive them, miners and crafters build the tools and weapons required for all the ) which means people have specialized in those fields (Hunting, Farming, Mining, Healing, Crafting), the burgeoning society is abled to reach the next step.

# Phase B

Reaching the Pilot command to gain control of the ship which is currently orbiting a star.
