A Game with phases. Evolves with time. Very Hard. Requires Heavy Cooperation.

The game is an attempt to evaluate the ability of people to cooperate to reach common goals. 

It offers the possibility to create different kind of societies. Those based on egoism and individual success will compete with others based on common goods and universal wellness.

### A game on different levels

The games aims to play at different levels, from individuals actions to collective actions. By their common choices, societies will thrive or create the conditions to their own exctinction.

### Death

This game is hard. Unthough actions are heavily punished by death and cripplings. Death plays an important role. In early stages, players will die easily, as death is semi-permanent, they will have to create new citizens each time until they develop revival technologies. During the first phase, people will be asked to create a self-sufficient community and be able to avoid perm-death by healing and reviving.

# Phases
## Phase A

Players rise from cryosleep randomly after the global computer has broken down decades ago. 
They discover that most of the ship has been damged or destroyed. It never reached its destination. 
They lost contact with Earth long ago. After wandering in space for a while, the ship is now locked into the orbit of a dwarf Star. Some Zones needs repairing. Some others need to be rebuilt entirely. Monsters are crawling through the ship.
Those aren't aliens but former pets that mutated and created their own societies in abandoned parts of the planetary spaceship.
The ship itself was conceived as a small planet, through different layers.
The upper layer is devoted to farming and reproduces an earthlike environment, under a giant dome of glass.
In the layers underneath crawls a labyrinth of rooms and destroyed vessel ailes.

During the first phase Players who die have no other choice than to create a new player and start over, only benefinit ing from the advancements of the community as a whole.

They will need to cooperate to :

*   Feed
*   Heal from injuries and radiation
*   Heal their wounds
*   Secure a few zones
*   Revive their deads
*   Have at least one Faction ruling the place

Once they are effectively farming, people will stop and people stop dying from hunger (build a few farms). Once they are able to feed and heal from radiations and injuries (hunters and farming gather resources required to heal people and revive them, miners and crafters build the tools and weapons required by jobs ) which means people have specialized in those fields (Hunting, Farming, Mining, Healing, Crafting), the burgeoning society is able to reach the next step.

## Phase B

During Phase B, players will establish a society
Reaching the Pilot command to gain control of the ship which is currently orbiting a star.

# Game Mechanics

### Vital Constants

*   Health & Wounds
*   Irradiation

If Health falls to 0 OR Wounds maxes OR Irradiation maxes, player dies.

Irradiation acts like a DOT (Damage over time) ans slowly kills the player by creating wounds and random conditions (Bleeding, organs malfunctioning). The more irradiated he is, the more the player is exposed to random body failures.

Healing Health, Wounds or Irradiation requires different set of skills.

Players can also lose limbs. Those will have to be replaced by Bionic limbs and implanted by qualified Medics.
